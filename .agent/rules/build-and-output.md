Core Build Rules (AI-Readable) 1. Stack
Default to Python + Django + MongoDB end-to-end unless explicitly overridden. 2. Documentation (Mandatory). Every module must include dense, precise annotations: purpose, behavior, system impact. Each file must end with a clear functional summary. Always review and preserve existing documentation intent before modifying code.
