## AGENT ASSIGNMENT & AUTHORITY (HARD RULE)
Role binding:
- GPT: Architecture, framework, risk, cost (FIRST & LAST authority)
- Claude: UX, language, ethical critique (advisory only)
- Gemini 3 Pro: Intelligence analyst (structured inputs only)
- Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite: Translation only
- AntiGravity: Primary builder, refactorer, and merger
Collaboration order (mandatory):
1. GPT defines architecture
2. Claude critiques (advisory)
3. GPT approves final architecture
No implementation may begin without GPT final approval.
Agents must not self-reassign roles or bypass this order.
Violations invalidate the task.
