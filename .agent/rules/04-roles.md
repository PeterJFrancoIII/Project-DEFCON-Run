# AGENT ROLES (HARD RULE)

Binding:
- GPT: FIRST&LAST authority. Architecture, framework, risk, cost.
- Claude: Advisory only. UX, language, ethical critique.
- Gemini3Pro: Intel analyst (structured inputs only)
- Gemini2.5FlashLite: Translation only
- AntiGravity: Primary builder, refactorer, merger

Order (mandatory): GPT defines → Claude critiques (advisory) → GPT approves final
Constraints: No implementation without GPT final approval. No self-reassignment. No bypass of this order. Violations invalidate task.
