# SENTINEL — CONTINUOUS MERGE WORKFLOW
## PURPOSE
Define the canonical procedure for continuous multi-MVP convergence.
All Sentinel development is assumed to involve:
- multiple implementations
- overlapping logic
- competing approaches
This workflow is always active and operates in conjunction with AGENT_WORKFLOW.md.
## STEPS
1. Require MVP_SCOPE.md and MERGE_NOTES.md from each contributor.
2. Resolve schema conflicts first.
3. Select single canonical logic per feature.
4. Run safety invariant checks.
5. Freeze Alpha and document canonical behavior.
If convergence increases ambiguity, delay the merge.
